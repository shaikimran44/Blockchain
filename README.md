The Animal Shelter is examining adoption records for animals that stayed in the shelter for a longer duration before being adopted. By focusing on animals that arrived before a specific past date, the team hopes to assess how long-term shelter residents are being adopted and by whom.
To support this, a query is used to retrieve the Adopter's Full Name, Animal Name, Date of Arrival at the Shelter, and Adoption Date for animals that arrived at the shelter before October 20, 2023.
This helps the shelter evaluate which adopters are more likely to adopt long-staying animals and plan outreach programs accordingly.The result should have the following columns: full_name animal_name shelter_arrival  adoption_date full_name - full name of the adopteranimal_name - name of the adopted animalshelter_arrival - the date the animal was brought into the shelteradoption_date - the date when the animal was adoptedSort the results by adopter's full name in ascending order and animal name in descending order.Rules: Include only animals that arrived at the shelter before October 20, 2023.Schema:they are four table which is linked with others 1.animal table which has primary key animal_id Int, and other data 2.adoptions table which has primary key adoption_id INT,foriegn key animal_id int,foriegn key animal_id int,foreign key adopter_id int, and other data, 3.adopters table which has primary key adopter_id int and other data 4.vaccinations table which has primary key vaccine_id and foreign key animal_id int and other data
