Objective:To work with classes and objectsConcept Explanation:Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming: Classes serve as blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Objects are instances of classes. They are concrete entities created based on the structure defined by a class. Each object has its own set of attributes and can perform actions defined by its class's methods.Concept Implementation:The Restaurant class is designed to represent a restaurant order. It encapsulates the details of an order such as the customer's name, order number, delivery type, food name, and phone number. Additionally, it provides a method to calculate the total bill amount based on the delivery type and the cost of the food item. The UserInterface class is responsible for managing user interaction and handling input. It collects details from the user, creates an instance of the Restaurant class with the input data, validates the delivery type, and displays the relevant information back to the user.Scenario:Brilliant Restaurant is a newly started restaurant. They provide home delivery to customers and planned to automate the bill generation process, based on the type of order. You, being their software consultant, have been approached to develop software
    to implement the functionality to generate the bill.

                This method should calculate the total bill based on the deliveryType and return the calculated bill amount.
            

        
    


 




Note: The class and methods should be declared as public and all the attributes should be declared as private.

Formula to calculate the bill
amount in the Restaurant class:

Bill amount = ( Cost * Tax ) + Cost


    
        
            
                deliveryType
            

            
                Tax
            

        
        
            
                HomeDelivery
            

            
                0.8
            

        
        
            
                Parcel
            

            
                0.5
            

        
        
            
                NormalOrder
            

            
                0.3
            

        
    


Note: The deliveryType is case sensitive.

Example:Bill amount= [Cost (of a ChickenBurger) * Tax (deliveryType is of NormalOrder) ] + Cost (of a ChickenBurger) 

Bill amount = (18 * 0.3 ) + 18 = 23.4

 

In the UserInterface class, write the main method.

Get the values from the user.

When the deliveryType is not any of the specified type ( i.e , HomeDelivery, Parcel, NormalOrder) , then print "Invalid Order Type " and terminate the program. 

Display the result as shown in the sample output.
