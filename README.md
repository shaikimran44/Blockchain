RSVP, short for "Répondez S'il Vous Plaît" (French for "Please Respond"), is a request for invitees to confirm their attendance, helping with event preparation. An event planner can use the system to manage RSVPs by inputting a guest list, tracking their attendance statuses, and viewing a filtered list of confirmed guests for efficient planning.

                1
            
            RSVPHandler
            
                Add a guest records to the rsvpList

                This method should add the guest's details to the RSVP list, which is implemented as an ArrayList.
                Constraints:
                
                
                     rsvp contains guestName and status separated by colon ( : ).

                This method should iterate over the rsvpList, check for guests with "confirmed" status, and return the names of confirmed guests in a new List.
                 Constraints: 
                
                
                    status is case-insensitive.
                    The method should return a List of Strings.
                
                
            
        
    

You are provided with the main method in the UserInterface class as code template, and it is excluded from evaluation.
Note:

    Edit only the  RSVPHandler class to implement the business requirements.
    The methods should be public, and the attributes of the class should be private. 
    In the Sample Input/Output provided, the highlighted text in bold corresponds to the input given by the user and the rest of the text represents the output.
    Ensure that the names for classes, attributes, and methods are provided as specified in the question description.
    Please do not use System.exit(0); to terminate the program.

 
Sample Input/Output 1:
